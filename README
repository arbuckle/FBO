Overview:
FBORetrieve scrapes data from the "interested vendors list" on FBO.gov.

This functionality can be used to generate cold-calling leads targeting 
specific industries, as a lot of the vendors on the site are small firms 
who are not accustomed to being targeted by sales teams.  


History:
This software was written for a personal friend who was manually parsing
data from the web in order to generate leads for a sales job.  She is no
longer affiliated with that company, which was not interested in licensing
the software, hence the open-source release.


Usage info:
- Tested for windows compatibility only.
- Accepts input in the form of an opportunity link from FBO.gov search results
- When the 'Auto' button is clicked, data is copied directly to the clipboard 
  in a format that's good for pasting into Excel.
- A log file is generated so that users can go back and revisit old 
  opportunities, as new vendors add their information regularly.


Dependencies:
- BeautifulSoup(to parse data from web)
- pyWin32 (for clipboard)
